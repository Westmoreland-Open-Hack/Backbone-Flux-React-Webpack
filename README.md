### Flux & React backed by backbone

Following this tutorial http://www.toptal.com/front-end/simple-data-flow-in-react-applications-using-flux-and-backbone

I have build a sample application that uses backbone models instead of flux stores to get lots of backbone features

This maintains top down control but allows components to rely on EventEmiter through backbone models and Item Collections

Enjoy
